The Project Marking Problem
Harry Mumford-Turner

1. How you solved the problem of synchronizing your threads.
- For synchronizing threads
  - Single Mutex
  - Single condidition
  - Some global variables
    - Total number of markers available
    - Total number of students finished
    - A list of states for each marker, busy | idle
    - A list of states for each demo, on | off
    - A list of markers a student has grabbed

- Add if (err) { conditions! }
  - Added around the starting and ending of threads

2. Why your method is correct (or how it could be made correct).

3. Why your method is efficient (or how it could be improved).

  - Using Semaphores!

Do not include any program trace output in your report. Instead, you need to give a
convincing argument in English why your program is correct and efficient, or how it could
be improved.
